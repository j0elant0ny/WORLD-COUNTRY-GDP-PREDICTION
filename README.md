# 🌍 WORLD-COUNTRY-GDP-PREDICTION

Developed a **Supervised Machine Learning** system that estimates a country's **GDP per capita** using various **regression algorithms**.  
The primary goal of the project is to understand the dataset, extract insights, and build a model to **predict GDP per capita** for each country.

## 📊 Data Source

We used the [**Countries of The World**](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world) dataset by **Fernando Lasso** from Kaggle.

- **Total Countries**: 227  
- **Number of Features**: 20  
- Each row represents a country, and each column is a specific socio-economic or geographic indicator.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze and clean the dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Train and evaluate different regression models  
- Compare models using performance metrics  
- Predict GDP per capita for countries

## 🛠️ Regression Models Used

1. **Linear Regression**  
2. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
3. **Random Forest Regressor**  
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

## ✅ Conclusion

After training and testing, we found:

- 🔍 **Random Forest Regressor** gave the best performance overall  
- 🌱 **Gradient Boosting** followed closely  
- 📉 **SVM** performed the worst in terms of accuracy

**Best Model:** `Random Forest Regressor`  
**Using:** All features in the dataset

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics (Best Model - Random Forest)

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: `2142.13`  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: `3097.19`  
- **R-squared Score (R²)**: `0.8839`
